## Group defaults

Operations in one HTTP group usually repeat the same middleware, problem
registry, OpenAPI annotator and access policy. Declare those once on the group.
Spec: `docs/specs/0013-group-defaults.md`; implementation:
`packages/compiler/src/group-defaults.ts`, `extensions/http-group.ts`.

```
 Http.group({ root, group, defaults })      @Http.Group({ root, group, defaults })
        ▲                                          ▲   (decorates the class)
        │ .in(group)                               │ static methods inherit
 Operation.query/command(...)               @Query/@Command(...) static method
```

**Defaults are source syntax.** Before interpretation the compiler expands them
into each operation's ordinary annotations. They are not a new IR node, are not
serialized (`defaults` never reaches the IR), and no application function is
called while compiling. A dense and a fully spelled-out declaration with the
same meaning have the same canonical IR, semantic hash and generated files.

### Options

| Option                                                                                    | Meaning                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`                                                                                    | string (local roots) or an exported concrete `HttpApi` value (required for external groups)       |
| `group`                                                                                   | group identifier                                                                                  |
| `title`, `description`, `displayName`                                                     | group OpenAPI metadata                                                                            |
| `defaults.middleware`                                                                     | security/middleware marker classes                                                                |
| `defaults.metadata.annotator`                                                             | exported function `(metadata) => Context` merged onto each endpoint                               |
| `defaults.problems.registry`                                                              | exported `ProblemRegistry`; fills an existing `Http.Problems` that omits `registry`               |
| `defaults.access.{annotator, exposure, acceptedCredentials, principalKinds, concealment}` | fills an existing `Http.Access`; never invents capabilities, requirements, scope or decision time |

Source: `packages/runtime/src/Annotation.ts` (`HttpGroupOptions`).

### Merge and inference rules

- Merging is **per field**. An explicit operation field wins over the same
  group field, even an empty array (`middleware: []`).
- `.in(group)` / the class decorator supplies `root` and `group` to the
  operation's `Http.Contract`. `Http.Contract` is still written on every HTTP
  operation (otherwise `EFFX2405`).
- Defaults fill an annotation that exists. They never create `Http.Problems`
  (it needs its own `codes`) or `Http.Access` (it needs its own capabilities).
- Operation id: when `metadata.operationId` is absent and the operation `name`
  is exactly `<group>.<safe key>`, that name is the operation id. An explicit
  id wins.
- `Http.Contract.success` defaults to the declared `success`.
  `query: true` on a GET `Query` means the declared `input`. For POST/PATCH
  `Command`, an omitted `payload` defaults to `input` unless `input` is
  already assigned to params, query or headers. Incompatible use is a
  diagnostic, never a guessed route shape.
- A group never mixes local and external operations (`EFFX2403`).

### Diagnostics

| Code       | Condition                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EFFX2404` | group reference is unresolved, not exported, not a group, repeated or multiple                                          |
| `EFFX2405` | explicit `root`/`group` conflicts with the group; bad `query: true`; ambiguous request mapping; missing `Http.Contract` |
| `EFFX2406` | two distinct raw group ids normalize to the same generated export name in one root                                      |

An operation with both a class-level `@Http.Group` and `.in(...)` fails with
`EFFX2404`. The reference must resolve statically to one exported group in the
same project; no runtime import happens.

### Status

Implemented (`STATE.md`: Schools, SocialEvents and Profile rows consume it;
spec 0013 is the contract). Group export names derive PascalCase parts at
`-`, `_` and `.` (`social-events` produces `SocialEventsApi`).
